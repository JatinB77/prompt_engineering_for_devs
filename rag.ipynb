This field aims to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing for a more seamless interaction and understanding between machines and humans. It allows computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment, and determine which parts are important. Its main goal is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human language in a valuable manner.\n"
